# Property Management System Algorithms

This project Property Management System, is a C++ program designed to facilitate property rental and management for the Klang Valley region in Malaysia. The system allows users, including tenants, managers, and admins to interact with property listings, manage rental processes, and access essential property data. This system employs efficient data structures and algorithms to enhance functionality and user experience.

## Algorithms Used
To support data handling, various sorting and searching algorithms are implemented:

- Quick Sort: Used to sort property listings by attributes such as monthly rent, location, and property size for efficient display and filtering.
- Insertion Sort: Applied to organize property data in cases requiring less intensive sorting, optimizing performance for smaller or partially sorted data sets.
- Binary Search: Enables rapid lookup of property listings by ID, improving search efficiency in sorted lists.
- Linear Search: Allows for flexible searches on unsorted property data based on specific criteria.
